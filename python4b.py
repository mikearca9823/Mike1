# Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many 
# days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

# It will take your current age as the input and output a message 
# with our time left in this format:

# You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.

# Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.


# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
age = int(input("What is your current age? "))
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡
#Declare Variables
x = ((90 * 365) - (age * 365))
y = ((52 * 90) - (age * 52))
z = ((12 * 90) - (age * 12)) 
# Constants
total_years = 90


print(f"You have {x} days, {y}weeks, and {z} months left until you turn 90 years old.")
